A demo notebook for Dow Jones News Fund data interns

During the week’s training, you will work on a project called
Investigate Your Community to produce detailed story pitches relevant to
their summer internship positions. The goal is to have the students
research a topic relevant to your newsroom so they can get to work
immediately at the internship.

Here are some examples from last year’s DJNF data journalism training:

Hannah Rosenberger, at ASI Media/Counselor magazine, produced this
analysis on name, image and likeness trends:
<https://hrosenberger.github.io/ASI-NIL-Project/>

Shifra Dayak, an intern at the Connecticut Mirror, produced this
analysis of environment spill data:
<https://shifradayak.github.io/DJNF_Merrill/ct_env_spills.html>.

Michael Zhang, an intern at the Houston Landing, explored local election
data: <https://michaelzhangreporter.github.io/Houston_Campaign_Finance/>

Here's what your newsroom suggested for a project:

***The team has decided to request Diego research people paying taxes to
the IRS via ITIN number. Please let me know if you have any
questions.cHave a great weekend! Yolanda***

This notebook helps you get started by extracting data from Table 1 of
this report: <https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/>

# Questions

Write down questions you want answered:

-   What is the per capita rate for tax totals per state. (tidycensus
    undocumented counts)?

-   Do states with favorable policies toward undocumented immigrants
    have friendly tax policies like rates (how will you define favorable
    policies)?

-   What are the other taxes undocumented immigrants pay and why do
    Californian undocumented immigrants pay almost 40% of nationwide
    other taxes.

A very good article about the issue
<https://unidosus.org/blog/2025/03/24/when-dhs-requests-itin-tax-data-why-every-american-should-be-concerned/>

Background on ITIN
<https://www.irs.gov/tin/itin/individual-taxpayer-identification-number-itin>
If you're a resident alien, nonresident alien or their spouse or
dependent, you can apply for an ITIN regardless of immigration status.

Resident alien or nonresident alien

If you're not a U.S. citizen, your tax status can be either:

Resident alien – If you were present in the U.S. for more than 183
days\* (substantial presence test) or you’re a lawful permanent resident
of the U.S. (green card test) Nonresident alien – If you don’t meet
either the green card or substantial presence test for resident alien
status. \*Special day-counting rules apply to certain foreign
government-related individuals, teachers, trainees and students who are
temporarily present in the U.S. under certain U.S. visas.
